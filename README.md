# ZK ECDSA Verifier 
This is a simple Noir circuit for verifying signatures off-chain created as part of following the Cyfrin Updraft "Noir Programming And ZK Circuits" course. I've uploaded it to Github for both educational purposes and as a reference. 

Both the Noir language as well as the ecrecover library are in beta release as of writing and not yet ready for production use. 

If you want to learn more about Noir like I did, you should check out Cyfrin Updraft. It's pretty cool 🤙
